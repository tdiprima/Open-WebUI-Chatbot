# Open WebUI Chatbot

To get started, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm start
```

Once you've initialized the server, you can open the `index.html` file in VS Code.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in VS Code.
2. Right-click on the file and select "Open with Live Server".

Your web browser should automatically open at http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html. If it's not port 5500, you need to adjust the CORS origin in `server.js`.

To interact with the chatbot, simply enter your prompt in the web page and click the "Send" button.
