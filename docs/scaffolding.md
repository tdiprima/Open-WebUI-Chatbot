This scaffolding includes the following components:

1. **Server-side (Node.js):**
   - An Express.js server that serves static files from the `public` directory.
   - A `/api/chatbot` POST endpoint that receives questions and returns sample responses. You will need to implement your custom chatbot logic in this endpoint.

2. **Client-side (HTML/JavaScript):**
   - A simple chatbot interface with a chat window, a question input field, and a send button.
   - Event listeners on the send button that trigger the fetch call to the `/api/chatbot` endpoint.
   - Functions to display messages in the chat window.

To use this scaffolding, you'll need to:

1. Implement your custom chatbot logic in the `/api/chatbot` endpoint.
2. Integrate your API endpoint with the client-side code, replacing the `fetchChatbotResponse` function.
3. Customize the UI and styling as needed.
